It is a fixed-width theme based on the Basic starter theme (https://drupal.org/project/basic). The header image was created by Wendy Minatogawa (https://groups.drupal.org/user/515644), using artwork created by and licensed from Albert Campbell. To best use this theme: In the theme's configuration, leave the primary links enabled and disable the secondary links. Do not put the primary links block in any region. Put the secondary links block in the Footer region, and disable its block title.
